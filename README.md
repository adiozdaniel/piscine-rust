# Piscine Rust

Welcome to **Piscine Rust**!

This repository is a set of exercises designed to help you learn and master the Rust programming language. It is structured as a series of progressively more challenging tasks that will guide you through Rust's key concepts, syntax, and patterns, ultimately helping you become proficient in writing efficient, robust, and idiomatic Rust code.

The goal of this Piscine is to familiarize you with Rust's features, including but not limited to its memory safety, concurrency model, functional programming features, and its powerful type system. These exercises are meant to be completed sequentially, building on the skills you've learned from each task.

## Why Piscine Rust?

The term "Piscine" comes from the French word for "swimming pool," and it represents an immersive and hands-on learning experience. By tackling real coding problems, you’ll dive deep into the language and develop practical Rust programming skills. This process helps you learn by doing, which is one of the best ways to internalize concepts.

### What will you learn?

- **Rust Syntax & Concepts**: Understand the basic building blocks of Rust, including variables, data types, loops, and control flow.
- **Functions**: Learn how to define and call functions, pass arguments, return values, and handle function signatures.
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: Deep dive into Rust’s ownership model, which guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector.
- **Structs & Enums**: Explore how to define complex types, represent data models, and work with both structs and enums.
- **Collections**: Master Rust’s powerful collections, like vectors and hashmaps, to manage and manipulate groups of data.
- **Error Handling**: Use Rust’s `Result` and `Option` types to manage errors and handle unexpected conditions gracefully.
- **Concurrency**: Gain an understanding of Rust’s safe concurrency features, which make it possible to write concurrent programs with confidence.
- **Testing**: Learn how to write tests in Rust and use them to validate your code.

### Who is this for?

This course is suitable for anyone interested in learning Rust, regardless of prior experience. Whether you're brand new to programming or you already have experience with other languages, the exercises will help you grasp Rust’s concepts and syntax quickly and effectively. It's perfect for those who prefer hands-on learning with real-world coding challenges.

## Structure of the Piscine

The exercises in this Piscine are organized into levels, with each level containing progressively more difficult tasks. The idea is to help you build a solid foundation in Rust, and each task is designed to test your understanding of the language and its features.

1. **Basic Syntax & Functions**: Exercises that introduce the Rust syntax, basic data types, functions, and how to manipulate them.
2. **Data Structures**: Dive deeper into more complex data structures, including arrays, vectors, and tuples.
3. **Memory Safety**: Work on exercises that focus on Rust's ownership, borrowing, and lifetime system to ensure memory safety.
4. **Advanced Concepts**: Challenges that will expose you to more advanced Rust features such as structs, enums, error handling, and iterators.
5. **Project-based Exercises**: Apply what you've learned in more integrated tasks that simulate real-world use cases, like working with matrices, implementing algorithms, and more.

## How to Use This Repository

Each exercise includes the following:

- **Instructions**: A description of what you need to implement and any specific requirements.
- **Function Signatures**: The function names and their expected parameters and return types.
- **Examples**: Example code snippets that show how to use your functions and test your solution.
- **Hints**: Some exercises may include hints to help you along the way if you get stuck.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. **Set Up Your Rust Environment**: Ensure that you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install it from the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
3. **Start Working on Exercises**: Each exercise is in a separate folder, and you'll find a `.rs` file for each task. Modify the code inside to complete the exercise.
4. **Testing**: Each task has its own testing setup, so you can validate your solution by running the tests with `cargo test`.
5. **Commit Your Progress**: As you solve each exercise, commit your changes and move on to the next task.

## Notions Covered

As you work through the exercises, you'll encounter key Rust notions such as:

- **Primitives**: Working with basic types like integers, floats, and booleans.
- **Functions & Method Signatures**: Understanding how to define and call functions, pass parameters, and handle returns.
- **Control Flow**: Working with conditionals, loops, and match expressions to control the flow of the program.
- **Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes**: Key Rust concepts that ensure memory safety and prevent bugs like data races.
- **Structs and Enums**: Creating custom data types to represent complex structures.
- **Error Handling**: Using `Result` and `Option` to handle errors in a structured manner.
- **Traits**: Implementing traits to define shared behavior across different types.
- **Concurrency**: Writing concurrent Rust programs that are memory safe.
